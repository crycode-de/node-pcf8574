# Changelog

## 4.0.0 WIP

- Queue up multiple requested polls instead of rejecting them if an other poll is currently active
  ðŸ’¥ This may be a breaking change if you rely on the rejection to prevent multiple polls
- Added method `isPolling()` to get the current polling state

## v3.1.0 2023-04-12

- Fix issues if enableInterrupt() invoked multiple times with same or different gpio pin number. (thanks to Lyndel McGee [#55](https://github.com/crycode-de/node-pcf8574/issues/55), [#56](https://github.com/crycode-de/node-pcf8574/pull/56))
  ðŸ’¥ This may be a breaking change if you called `enabledInterrupt()` multiple times without calling `disableInterrupt()` first - wich was never intended!

## v3.0.1 2023-03-21
